# Clipy - Advanced Clipboard Manager

A comprehensive clipboard manager for macOS that extends your clipboard functionality with advanced features, persistent history, and snippet management.

## Overview

Clipy is a feature-rich clipboard manager that runs in the macOS menu bar. Based on the popular Clipy application architecture, it provides advanced clipboard monitoring, persistent storage, snippet management, and extensive customization options.

## Features

- **Memory Management**: Configurable history size limits with automatic cleanup

### Advanced Menu System
- **Dynamic Menus**: Automatically updating menu system with live clipboard data
- **Numeric Shortcuts**: Keyboard shortcuts (0-9) for quick access to recent items

- **CGEvent Simulation**: Multiple CGEvent-based paste methods for reliability
- **Permission Handling**: Comprehensive accessibility and AppleEvent permission checking
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to clipboard-only operation with user notifications

### Preferences & Customization
- **Comprehensive Settings**: Detailed preferences window with multiple panels
- **Visual Customization**: Configure menu icons, image display, and color previews
- **Timing Controls**: Adjustable monitoring intervals
- **Login Items**: Optional launch at login functionality
- **Sound Effects**: Multiple sound effect options with preview functionality

## Requirements

- macOS 10.12 or later
- Swift 5.3 or later (command line tools)

## Building the Project

Use the provided build script for easy building:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

To build and run immediately:
```bash
./build.sh run
```

Or manually with Swift Package Manager:
```bash
swift build
```

## Running the Application

After building, run the application:

For FULL paste functionality (recommended):
```bash
./Clipy.app/Contents/MacOS/Clipy
```

Alternative method (paste limitations):
```bash
open Clipy.app
```
â†’ When using 'open', automatic paste may not work due to macOS security
â†’ Content will still be copied to clipboard for manual paste (âŒ˜+V)

### Paste Functionality Notes

For full paste functionality, Clipy requires accessibility permissions. Due to macOS security restrictions, the paste feature works more reliably when running the application directly from the command line rather than using the `open` command.

If paste functionality doesn't work:
1. Grant accessibility permissions in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility
2. Consider running Clipy directly from Terminal for best compatibility
3. Refer to the `paste_troubleshooting_guide.md` for detailed troubleshooting steps

The application will appear in your macOS menu bar as ðŸ“‹

PASTE FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Accessibility permissions (System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility)
- AppleScript permissions (will be prompted automatically)
- For best results: run directly from terminal, not via 'open' command

If paste doesn't work automatically, the app will:
1. Copy content to clipboard
2. Show notification to press âŒ˜+V manually
3. Provide guidance on fixing permissions

## Usage

### Basic Operation
1. Copy any content (text, images, files) to your clipboard
2. Click the ðŸ“‹ icon in your menu bar to access your clipboard history
3. Select any item to paste it back to your clipboard
4. Use numeric keys (0-9) for quick access to recent items

### Managing Snippets
1. Click "Edit Snippets..." from the menu
2. Create folders to organize your snippets
3. Add frequently used text snippets
4. Access snippets from the "Snippets" submenu

### Customizing Settings
1. Click "Preferences..." from the menu
2. Configure history size, sound effects, visual options
3. Set up app exclusions and monitoring intervals
4. Enable/disable login at startup

## Architecture

The application follows modern Swift development patterns with a service-oriented architecture:

- **Constants.swift**: Application-wide configuration and constants
- **Models.swift**: Data models for clips, snippets, folders, and app info
- **Services.swift**: Core business logic services (ClipService, MenuManager, SnippetService, PasteService)
- **Extensions.swift**: Useful extensions for system types and utilities
- **PreferencesWindow.swift**: UI controllers for preferences and snippet editor
- **UIConstants.swift**: UI styling constants and extensions
- **main.swift**: Application delegate and main menu management

## Data Storage

- Clipboard data stored in `~/Library/Application Support/Clipy/`
- Thumbnails and metadata cached for performance
- Preferences managed through UserDefaults
- Automatic cleanup of old data files
- Thread-safe file operations with proper locking

## Development Conventions

- Swift-based macOS application using AppKit
- Service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Reactive-style updates using NotificationCenter
- Protocol-oriented programming patterns
- Thread-safe operations for data handling
- MVVM architecture for UI components
