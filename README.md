## Requirements

- macOS 10.12 or later
- Swift 5.3 or later (command line tools)

## Building the Project

Use the provided build script for easy building:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

To build and run immediately:
```bash
./build.sh run
```

Or manually with Swift Package Manager:
```bash
swift build
```

## Running the Application

After building, run the application:
```bash
open Clipy.app
```

Or directly (recommended for best paste functionality):
```bash
./Clipy.app/Contents/MacOS/Clipy
```

### Paste Functionality Notes

For full paste functionality, Clipy requires accessibility permissions. Due to macOS security restrictions, the paste feature works more reliably when running the application directly from the command line rather than using the `open` command.

If paste functionality doesn't work:
1. Grant accessibility permissions in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility
2. Consider running Clipy directly from Terminal for best compatibility
3. Refer to the `paste_troubleshooting_guide.md` for detailed troubleshooting steps

For comprehensive troubleshooting of paste issues, please see the `paste_troubleshooting_guide.md` file.

## Usage

### Basic Operation
1. Copy any content (text, images, files) to your clipboard
2. Click the ðŸ“‹ icon in your menu bar to access your clipboard history
3. Select any item to paste it back to your clipboard
4. Use numeric keys (0-9) for quick access to recent items

### Managing Snippets
1. Click "Edit Snippets..." from the menu
2. Create folders to organize your snippets
3. Add frequently used text snippets
4. Access snippets from the "Snippets" submenu

### Customizing Settings
1. Click "Preferences..." from the menu
2. Configure history size, sound effects, visual options
3. Set up app exclusions and monitoring intervals
4. Enable/disable login at startup

## Architecture

The application follows modern Swift development patterns:

- **Constants.swift**: Application-wide configuration and constants
- **Models.swift**: Data models for clips, snippets, folders, and app info
- **Services.swift**: Core business logic services (ClipService, MenuManager, SnippetService, PasteService)
- **Extensions.swift**: Useful extensions for system types and utilities
- **PreferencesWindow.swift**: UI controllers for preferences and snippet editor
- **main.swift**: Application delegate and main menu management

## Data Storage

- Clipboard data stored in `~/Library/Application Support/Clipy/`
- Thumbnails and metadata cached for performance
- Preferences managed through UserDefaults
- Automatic cleanup of old data files
- Thread-safe file operations with proper locking

## Technical Features

### Service Architecture
- **ClipService**: Handles clipboard monitoring and data management
- **MenuManager**: Manages dynamic menu creation and updates
- **SnippetService**: Handles snippet and folder management
- **PasteService**: Manages paste operations and event simulation

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Multi-format Support**: Text, RTF, images, PDFs, file URLs
- **Smart Paste**: Automatic paste simulation with proper event handling
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient storage and retrieval of clipboard data
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
