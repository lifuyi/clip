# Paste Functionality Test

## What was fixed:

The issue was that the `PasteService` was only setting the clipboard content but not actually pasting it into the currently focused application. 

## Changes made:

1. **Added `performPasteToFocusedApp()` method** in `Services.swift:PasteService`
   - This method simulates the ⌘+V keystroke using `CGEvent`
   - It first hides the menu to allow the previous app to regain focus
   - Then sends both key down and key up events for the 'V' key with Command modifier

2. **Updated both `paste(clip:)` and `paste(snippet:)` methods**
   - After successfully setting clipboard content, they now call `performPasteToFocusedApp()`
   - This ensures the content is both copied to clipboard AND pasted into the focused app

## How it works now:

1. User clicks on a clipboard item or snippet in the menu
2. The content is set to the system clipboard
3. The menu closes and the previous application regains focus
4. A ⌘+V keystroke is simulated, pasting the content into the focused application

## Testing instructions:

1. **Test with text editor:**
   - Open TextEdit or any text editor
   - Copy some text to clipboard (it should appear in Clipy)
   - Type some text in the editor
   - Click on a different clipboard item in Clipy menu
   - The selected text should automatically paste into the editor at cursor position

2. **Test with snippets:**
   - Create a snippet in Clipy preferences
   - Open any text editor
   - Click on the snippet in Clipy menu
   - The snippet content should automatically paste into the editor

3. **Test with multiple applications:**
   - Switch between different applications
   - Use Clipy to paste content
   - Content should paste into whichever application has focus

The paste functionality should now work correctly for both clipboard history items and snippets!
